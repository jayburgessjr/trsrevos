# Planning Checklist

## Before AI Coding
- [ ] Screenshot annotated
- [ ] Research notes written
- [ ] Architecture doc ready
- [ ] PRD drafted

## Planning Phase
- Ask AI: “Read the PRD, screenshot, and architecture doc. Create a step-by-step plan to implement these requirements in the existing codebase.”
- [ ] Review the AI-generated plan
- [ ] Clarify unclear steps
- [ ] Break large features into smaller PRDs if needed

## Coding Phase
- [ ] Let AI execute on the approved plan
- [ ] Test changes immediately
- [ ] Provide feedback in small chunks

✅ Output: Guardrails so AI doesn’t skip steps or overbuild.
