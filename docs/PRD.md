# PRD â€” TRS Internal SaaS (RevenueOS Copilot)

## Objective
Ship a governed internal workspace with TRS Score heartbeat, deliverables pipeline, agents, AI compliance, Exec Room export.

## MVP Scope
- TRS Score chip + banded playbooks
- Deliverables list/detail with status/owner/export
- Governance gate API/UI + audit log (stubbed)
- Agents roster (typed objects) bound to deliverables/KPIs (UI stub)
- AI Engine compliance panel (model card, thresholds, QA)
- Gap Map tiers + dollarized impact (UI stub)
- Exec Room export endpoint (stub)
- Partner scout scorecards (UI stub)
- KPIs & alerts page

## Acceptance Criteria
- TRS Score rendered across app; band change drives playbooks
- Deliverables CRUD + export link
- Governance gate blocks when unmet
- Auto-actions paused if below thresholds (UI reflected)
- Exec export returns artifact handle
