# TRS Copilot Transformation Roadmap

This roadmap sequences the recommended additions into coordinated phases so stakeholders can respond with "Start Phase N" when ready. Each phase builds toward a production-grade business, project, and sales management platform.

## Phase 1 — Data Foundation & Plumbing
1. **Supabase Integration Audit**
   - Inventory all tables (opportunities, invoices, focus sessions, analytics events, TRS scores, agent behaviors).
   - Document required CRUD operations per workspace and map current UI components to the needed queries/mutations.
2. **Replace Seeded Stores with Live Queries**
   - Implement shared data access layer (hooks/services) that read/write from Supabase using RLS-compliant policies.
   - Migrate executive, pipeline, finance, and project views off of in-memory mocks.
3. **Background Sync & Error Handling**
   - Add retryable jobs for ingesting email/calendar data and handling Supabase outages.
   - Surface loading/error states in UI with telemetry to tracing/observability stack.
4. **Security & Governance Baseline**
   - Configure Supabase row-level security per workspace persona.
   - Set up audit logging for critical mutations (deal stage changes, invoice edits, agent deployments).

**Exit Criteria**
- All dashboards and workspaces display real Supabase-backed data.
- CRUD flows persist reliably with telemetry and error reporting in place.
- Access controls and audit trails verified for core objects.

## Phase 2 — Sales Intelligence & Forecasting
1. **Pipeline Analytics**
   - Implement stage-weighted forecasting, commit/upside projections, and variance tracking.
   - Introduce opportunity scoring using historical win/loss data and agent signals.
2. **Revenue Automation**
   - Schedule automated data syncs with Gmail/Calendar and other integrations (CRM, billing) as needed.
   - Trigger alerts/notifications for risk deals, stalled stages, and expiring quotes.
3. **Forecast Review Workflows**
   - Build collaborative review views (comments, approvals) tied to executive dashboards.
   - Export forecasts to finance (CSV/API) with version history.

**Exit Criteria**
- Revenue leaders can run commit/upside scenarios and receive automated risk alerts.
- Pipeline reviews leverage collaborative tooling with auditable exports.

## Phase 3 — Project Execution & Client ROI
1. **Project Health Dashboards**
   - Surface burndown charts, resource allocations, and milestone risk indicators from Supabase data.
   - Connect TRS scores and sentiment analytics to client health timelines.
2. **Delivery Workflows**
   - Enable structured updates (status, blockers, decisions) with reminders and approval chains.
   - Integrate change-order tracking tied to invoices and opportunity amendments.
3. **Client ROI Narratives**
   - Combine delivery metrics, finance data, and survey feedback into executive-ready reports.
   - Automate sharing of quarterly business reviews with stakeholders.

**Exit Criteria**
- Project managers and client success see unified health dashboards with actionable insights.
- Delivery updates, change orders, and ROI narratives are persisted and shareable.

## Phase 4 — Operational Automation & Knowledge Layer
1. **Agent Governance & Memory**
   - Persist agent definitions, prompts, and guardrails in Supabase with lifecycle controls.
   - Stand up TRSOS memory layer with contextual retrieval for agents like Rosie.
2. **Analytics & Observability**
   - Emit structured analytics events for every critical workflow.
   - Build executive telemetry dashboards for adoption, performance, and compliance.
3. **Cross-Workspace Automations**
   - Orchestrate automations that span sales, delivery, and finance (e.g., closed-won → project kickoff → invoice schedule).
   - Provide playbook builder for ops to configure automations without code.

**Exit Criteria**
- Agents operate with governed memory and can act across sales/project/finance workflows.
- Leadership has unified analytics and configurable automations driving operations.

## Phase 5 — Continuous Improvement & Scaling
1. **Quality & Testing Frameworks**
   - Expand unit/e2e coverage for new data flows, forecasting logic, and automations.
   - Add synthetic monitoring for key journeys (login, pipeline update, status report submission).
2. **Performance & Scalability**
   - Load-test Supabase and Next.js APIs, implement caching/edge functions as necessary.
   - Optimize data-fetching and rendering for large datasets.
3. **Feedback & Iteration Loop**
   - Establish customer advisory board cadence to prioritize enhancements.
   - Instrument in-app feedback collection tied to roadmap backlog.

**Exit Criteria**
- Platform maintains reliability and performance under growing usage.
- Feedback loops drive ongoing prioritization and delivery cadence.

Use this roadmap to trigger execution iteratively (e.g., "Start Phase 1") while keeping stakeholders aligned on dependencies and desired outcomes.
