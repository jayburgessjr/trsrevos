# Pricing Strategies & Optimization

## Overview

Pricing is one of the highest-leverage interventions in revenue optimization. Small adjustments can yield immediate margin expansion without increasing costs.

## Core Pricing Models

### 1. Value-Based Pricing
Price based on the value delivered to customers, not cost-plus margins.

**When to use:**
- High differentiation
- Clear ROI for customers
- Low price sensitivity in target market

**Key metrics:**
- Customer LTV
- Value delivered ($)
- Competitive positioning

### 2. Tiered Pricing
Create multiple price points to capture different customer segments.

**Best practices:**
- 3-4 tiers maximum
- Clear feature differentiation
- Anchor pricing (middle tier most popular)

**Example structure:**
```
Starter: $99/mo  - Core features
Growth: $299/mo  - + Advanced features (MOST POPULAR)
Enterprise: $999/mo - + Premium support & customization
```

### 3. Usage-Based Pricing
Charge based on consumption metrics (API calls, seats, storage, etc.)

**Advantages:**
- Aligns with customer value
- Natural expansion revenue
- Lower barrier to entry

**Considerations:**
- Requires robust metering
- Can create revenue volatility
- May discourage usage

## Pricing Optimization Framework

### Step 1: Analyze Current State
- Segment customers by willingness to pay
- Calculate price elasticity
- Map value metrics to pricing

### Step 2: Test Price Points
Run A/B tests on:
- Landing page pricing
- Trial conversion offers
- Upgrade incentives

### Step 3: Monitor Impact
Track:
- Conversion rates by tier
- Average deal size
- Churn by price point
- Net revenue retention

## Common Pricing Mistakes

❌ **Cost-plus pricing** - Ignores market willingness to pay
❌ **Too many tiers** - Creates decision paralysis
❌ **Underpricing** - Leaves money on table
❌ **No regular increases** - Inflation erodes margins
❌ **Feature parity** - Tiers too similar

## Pricing Psychology Tactics

### Anchoring
Show higher price first to make target price seem reasonable.

### Charm Pricing
$99 vs $100 - Psychological difference matters.

### Decoy Pricing
Add expensive option to make middle tier attractive.

### Annual Discounts
Offer 15-20% off to improve cash flow and reduce churn.

## Price Increase Strategy

When raising prices:

1. **Grandfather existing customers** (6-12 months)
2. **Communicate value** - Show ROI improvements
3. **Offer lock-in** - Annual commit at old rate
4. **Time it right** - After product updates
5. **Test new cohorts first** - Minimize churn risk

## Tools & Resources

- **Price Sensitivity Meter**: Van Westendorp analysis
- **Conjoint Analysis**: Feature value mapping
- **Competitor Pricing**: Track 3-5 direct competitors
- **Win/Loss Analysis**: Lost deals by price objection
