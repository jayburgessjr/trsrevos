# Gap Map Framework

## What is a Gap Map?

The Gap Map is TRS's proprietary diagnostic framework for identifying revenue leaks and optimization opportunities across the entire customer lifecycle.

## Core Philosophy

**Every dollar of unrealized revenue has a root cause.** The Gap Map systematically identifies WHERE revenue is leaking and WHY, enabling targeted interventions with measurable ROI.

## The 7 Revenue Leak Categories

### 1. Acquisition Leaks
**Definition:** Lost revenue due to inefficient customer acquisition

**Common causes:**
- High CAC relative to LTV
- Poor targeting/ICP fit
- Inefficient channels
- Weak value proposition
- Sales cycle too long

**Diagnostic questions:**
- What's our CAC by channel?
- What % of leads are ICP-qualified?
- Where do deals stall in the pipeline?
- What's our win rate vs. competitors?

**Example interventions:**
- Refine ICP targeting
- Optimize channel mix
- Shorten sales cycle
- Improve win rate with better positioning

---

### 2. Activation Leaks
**Definition:** Users who sign up but never activate/get value

**Common causes:**
- Poor onboarding
- Aha moment not reached
- Product complexity
- Lack of use case clarity

**Diagnostic questions:**
- What % of trials activate?
- Time to first value?
- Where do users drop off?
- What actions predict conversion?

**Example interventions:**
- Streamline onboarding flow
- Trigger-based activation campaigns
- In-product guidance
- Success team early engagement

---

### 3. Monetization Leaks
**Definition:** Value delivered but not captured in pricing

**Common causes:**
- Underpricing
- No tiered structure
- Misaligned value metric
- Excessive discounting

**Diagnostic questions:**
- When did we last raise prices?
- What's our win rate by price point?
- How much value do we deliver vs. charge?
- What % of deals get discounted >20%?

**Example interventions:**
- Price increase (grandfathered)
- Introduce usage-based pricing
- Create value-based tiers
- Reduce discounting

---

### 4. Expansion Leaks
**Definition:** Existing customers not growing spend

**Common causes:**
- No expansion motion
- Product gaps
- Low engagement
- Poor upsell timing

**Diagnostic questions:**
- What's our net revenue retention (NRR)?
- What % of customers expand?
- What triggers expansion?
- Average expansion ACV?

**Example interventions:**
- Build upgrade paths
- Usage-based triggers
- Cross-sell playbooks
- Customer success-led expansion

---

### 5. Retention Leaks
**Definition:** Preventable churn

**Common causes:**
- Product-market fit gaps
- Poor customer success
- Unmet expectations
- Better alternatives

**Diagnostic questions:**
- What's our churn rate by cohort?
- Why are customers churning?
- Can we predict churn?
- What's our save rate?

**Example interventions:**
- Churn prediction model
- Proactive success outreach
- Product improvements
- Win-back campaigns

---

### 6. Efficiency Leaks
**Definition:** Revenue lost to operational inefficiency

**Common causes:**
- Manual processes
- Poor tooling
- Data silos
- Misaligned incentives

**Diagnostic questions:**
- What % of team time is manual?
- Where are data quality issues?
- What automations are missing?
- How aligned are teams?

**Example interventions:**
- Automate workflows
- Integrate systems
- Fix data pipelines
- Align compensation

---

### 7. Margin Leaks
**Definition:** Revenue erosion from cost structure

**Common causes:**
- High delivery costs
- Inefficient infrastructure
- Poor contract terms
- Vendor overspend

**Diagnostic questions:**
- What's our gross margin by product?
- Where are cost overruns?
- What's our unit economics trend?
- Are contracts optimized?

**Example interventions:**
- Renegotiate vendor contracts
- Optimize infrastructure
- Improve delivery efficiency
- Adjust pricing for low-margin products

## Gap Map Process

### Step 1: Data Aggregation (Week 1)
Collect data across:
- CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Product analytics (Mixpanel, Amplitude)
- Billing (Stripe, Chargebee)
- Finance (QuickBooks, NetSuite)
- Support (Zendesk, Intercom)

### Step 2: Leak Identification (Week 2)
For each category, quantify:
- **Current state**: What's happening?
- **Benchmark**: What's best-in-class?
- **Gap size**: Revenue at stake ($)
- **Root cause**: Why is this happening?

### Step 3: Prioritization (Week 2)
Score each leak on:
- **Impact**: Revenue opportunity ($)
- **Effort**: Implementation complexity (1-10)
- **Speed**: Time to results (days)
- **Confidence**: Likelihood of success (%)

**ROI Score = (Impact × Confidence) / (Effort × Speed)**

### Step 4: Intervention Design (Week 3)
For top 3-5 leaks, design:
- Hypothesis
- Experiment design
- Success metrics
- Timeline
- Ownership

### Step 5: Execution & Tracking (Ongoing)
- Implement interventions
- Monitor leading indicators
- Measure impact
- Iterate based on results

## Gap Map Output: The Revenue Blueprint

The Gap Map produces a **Revenue Blueprint** - a prioritized roadmap of interventions with:

1. **Executive Summary**: Top leaks and opportunities
2. **Detailed Analysis**: Each leak category breakdown
3. **Prioritization Matrix**: ROI-ranked interventions
4. **Implementation Roadmap**: 90-day action plan
5. **Success Metrics**: KPIs to track progress

## Example Gap Map: SaaS Company

| Leak Category | Annual Revenue at Stake | Root Cause | Intervention | ROI Score |
|---------------|------------------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| Monetization | $480K | Underpricing (no increase 3yr) | 8% price increase | 92 |
| Retention | $360K | No churn prediction | Build churn model + CS playbook | 85 |
| Expansion | $240K | No usage-based upsell | Implement seat-based triggers | 78 |
| Activation | $180K | Trial users not activating | Onboarding email sequence | 71 |
| Acquisition | $120K | High CAC on paid social | Shift budget to content | 54 |

**Total Revenue Opportunity: $1.38M**

**90-Day Focus: Price increase + churn model ($840K potential)**

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Boiling the ocean** - Trying to fix everything at once
❌ **Analysis paralysis** - Over-analyzing, under-executing
❌ **Ignoring quick wins** - Focusing only on big bets
❌ **No ownership** - Interventions without clear DRI
❌ **Not tracking** - Implementing without measuring

## Success Indicators

✅ Revenue leaks quantified with confidence
✅ Clear prioritization based on ROI
✅ Interventions have owners and timelines
✅ Leading indicators being tracked
✅ Wins celebrated and scaled
